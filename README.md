A new SaaS based deep performance diagnosis framework.
EagleEye aims to diagnose the performance and avaliability problems occur in the large distributed systems in real time.  Moreover, it can provide some gracefull performance recovery strategies and reliability assurance approaches such as optimal reboot for the distributed systems.

I prefer the contributers to  develop their code using python.
